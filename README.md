Reference: Kyung Hee University Regulation Management System

This tool is provided exclusively for regulation search within Kyung Hee University. For important information such as academic schedules or graduation requirements, always verify with official documents or by contacting the university administration office.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage
1. Environment Setup
bash
conda create -n langchain python=3.11
conda activate langchain
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Building the Vector Database
Create two folders: past_documents and todo_documents.

Place regulation-related materials (.pdf, .ipynb, .txt) in todo_documents.

Adding more file formats: Edit the load_documents_process_vectorize() function in add_document.py.

Run add_document.py to build the vector database.

The index.faiss and index.pkl files will be created in the faiss_db directory.

Files are automatically moved to past_documents after processing.

If a database already exists, previous files are backed up in the backup/ folder with the current timestamp.

3. System Prompt & Interface Customization
The base system prompt is defined in chains.py. Adapt this to suit your institution‚Äôs policies if necessary.

User (student/member) ID authentication is implemented in first_page.py to prevent unauthorized access via public links.

You may customize the welcome and instructions page to match the notice below.

4. Streamlit Secret Configuration

text
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY = "your_langchain_api_key"
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
student_ids = ["member1", "member2"]
5. Local Testing
bash
streamlit run main.py
6. Deployment
Upload the repository to Streamlit Cloud.
